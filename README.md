This project implement an engine that simulate a possible quantum ISA (instrucition set architecture).
Each instruction used in the engine can be implemented by a quantum circuit on a quantum computer.
An assembly language is defined and an assembler is given to tranlate it in to binary code. An 
high-level C-like programming language is also defined and the compiler is able to automatically 
handle garbage creation and cleaning.
The language, at the momement, supports: integer typed variables and arrays, conditional statements, 
loops, functions and recursion. In the future will be implemented support for float type and heap 
allocation.
