<h3>WORK IN PROGRESS, project not complete yet</h3>

<h1>QUANTUM ISA</h1>
This project implements an engine that simulate a possible quantum architecture with an associated instruction set architecture (ISA).
Each instruction used in the engine can be implemented by a quantum circuit on a quantum computer.
An assembly language is defined and an assembler is given to tranlate it in to binary code. An 
high-level C-like programming language is also defined and the compiler is able to automatically 
handle garbage creation and cleaning.
The language, at the momement, supports: integer typed variables and arrays, conditional statements, 
loops, functions, recursion, H and Z quantum operations. In the future will be implemented support for the Y quantum operation.
Additionally, will be soon available a complete documentation of the language.
